https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/
https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/ -- need to be implement done with design using quick-union, 
Two conditions 
1). either node has already a parent. So return node with its existing parent, as one node cannot have two parents 
2). or they are already connect via different path that is there is cycle if 1->2->3->4->1, when 4->1 union operation comes 
it is already connected by checking there parent.
